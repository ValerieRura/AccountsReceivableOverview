# Everleaf Paper Supplies Accounts Receivable Analysis

## Introduction
This project looks at the accounts receivable for Everleaf Paper Supplies, a company that sells paper to other businesses. They let customers buy paper right away or on credit, which means the customer can pay later in small amounts. This analysis helps manage and understand customer payments and disputes better.

## Objective
The main goal is to help the Finance Manager check and understand all the money that should be coming in from customers. This includes details about how and when customers pay and if there are any issues with the payments.

## Data Features
1. **Monthly Payment Tracking**: Shows how much each customer pays each month.
2. **Average Days Overdue**: Measures how late customers are with their payments, on average.
3. **Invoice Listing**: Lists all the bills and how much each customer owes.
4. **Dispute Records**: Keeps track of how many times a customer has disagreed with a bill.

## Project Goals
The aim is to make it easy for the Finance Manager to pick any customer and see detailed information about their payments and any problems with their bills. This information helps manage customer credit better and improve how payments are collected.
